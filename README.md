# KKManager
Mod, plugin and card manager for Koikatu! and Koikatsu Party. It can:
- browse cards and scenes (supports drag and drop so you can drag cards into the game to load them).
- browse installed zipmods and plugins, and view information about them.
- automatically find and install mod updates from the internet.
- fix some common issues with the game.
- install plugins and mods for you.

While the app is already useful, it's still in beta. Expect some bugs and lacking features. You can report issues on [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/bbepis/KKManager/issues), or on the [Koikatu! discord server](https://discord.gg/urDt8CK).

## How to use
1. Extract to a new folder anywhere.
2. Start KKManager.exe, create a shortcut to it if you want.
3. If the game directory was not automatically detected, select where you installed KK.

If there are any mod updates available, the update menu button on top will turn green after a while. You can click it without waiting to check for updates immediately.
