# KKManager
Mod, plugin and card manager for Koikatu! and Koikatsu Party. It can:
- browse cards and scenes (supports drag and drop so you can drag cards into the game to load them).
- browse installed zipmods and plugins, and view information about them.
- automatically find and install mod updates from the internet.
- fix some common issues with the game.
- install plugins and mods for you.

While the app is already useful, it's still in beta. Expect some bugs and lacking features. You can report issues on [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/bbepis/KKManager/issues), or on the [Koikatu! discord server](https://discord.gg/urDt8CK).

## How to use
1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KKManager/releases) page.
2. Extract to a new folder anywhere. If you want to update your current KK Manager install then it's recommended to remove all old files except for the .settings file.
3. Start KKManager.exe, create a shortcut to it if you want.
4. If the game directory was not automatically detected, select where you installed KK.

You can turn on automatic checking for updates in the Tools menu. If there are any mod updates available, the update menu button on top will turn green after a while. You can observe update process through the log window.
