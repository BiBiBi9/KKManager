# KKManager
Koikatu! card and mod manager. Can browse cards, zipmods and plugins and view information about all of them. There's also a basic mod installer included. Overall it makes it much easier to manually keep your game up-to-date.

While the app is already useful, expect some bugs and lacking features. You can report issues on [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/bbepis/KKManager/issues), or on the [Koikatu! discord server](https://discord.gg/urDt8CK).
